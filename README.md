# Working together is easy - How to integrate a UIKit project with SwiftUI

This folder contains the example used in the article "how to integrate a uikit project with swiftui".
In the article I describe how to integrate SwiftUI into a UIKit project in a quick and easy way.
First I show how to use a SwiftUI view directly in the storyboard file and then how to pass data from the UIKit layer to the SwiftUI layer and vice versa.
